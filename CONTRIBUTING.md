# Contributing

First of all, thanks for contributing to the rockylinux.org website! We're
happy you've decided to help up make our site & its content better, and we
hope you'd like to keep doing so in the future.

However, to the ends of keeping everything manageable and reducing stress on
every project member & collaborator, we need to set some policies on
contributions.

## Pull requests

Allow us to preface this by saying - All bug fixes, feature implementations,
documentation improvements, issues, etc. are all *very* much welcome. We
don't wish to discourage any such contributions, quite the opposite. With
that said, we must ask that:

- Pull requests must be linked to an issue and must be targeted towards the `develop` branch. If there is no issue currently
  open describing the issue/feature request you are contributing a solution
  to, open one yourself first, *before* you make a PR. This is to ensure that
  we know every part of our project is organized well, and makes sure that we
  are able to track every problem and enhancement the community would like to
  raise with us.

- Once an issue has been created, you wait until we have evaluated the impact
  of the issue, or the priority of the feature request, before creating your
  PR. By all means, make your changes preemptively in your own fork, but don't
  create a PR for any issues before a PR has been requested by maintainers.

Finally, you must understand & acknowledge that any changes you submit into our
project's version control history are licensed under the BSD 3-clause license,
the terms of which are described fully in the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file, located
at the root of this repository.
